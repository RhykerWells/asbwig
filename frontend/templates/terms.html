				<p class=" mb-0">Last updated: May 10, 2025</p>
				<p>Effective: May 10, 2025</p>
				<p>Welcome, and thank you for using ASBWIG, a service created, maintained, and provided by Rhyker Wells. These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access and use of any and all product(s) and other applications (the "Services") that I provide. If you have any questions, concerns, comments or queries regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact me via: <a href="mailto:admin@rhykerw.com" class="link-light">admin@rhykerw.com</a></p>
				<h4 class=" text-decoration-underline mt-5">Acceptance</h4>
				<p>These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Rhyker Wells ("me", "I", "we", "us") regarding your access to and use of ASBWIG and related services. By using ASBWIG, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a group, organization, or other entity, you confirm that you have the authority to do so.</p>
				<p>By using these services, you agree to any future changes in these Terms. If you do not agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them, in which case you must stop using the Services. Continued use of the Services after the changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
				<h4 class=" text-decoration-underline mt-5">Eligibility</h4>
				<p>By accessing or using the Services, you represent and warrant that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You are at least 13 years of age or the minimum age required in your country to use online services.</li>
					<li>If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction (typically under 18), you have obtained parental or legal guardian consent to use the Service and to agree to these Terms on your behalf.</li>
					<li>You are using the Service for personal or authorized use only, and not on behalf of any organization unless you are authorized to act on its behalf.</li>
					<li>You will follow all applicable laws and the Terms of Services provided by third parties that we rely on or integrate with.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4 class=" text-decoration-underline mt-5">Third Party Accounts</h4>
				<p>We may require you to log in or verify your identity from other services ("Third Party Account"), such as but not limited to Google or Discord. A Third Party Account is any account not operated by us, but used to authenticate your access to the Services.</p>
				<p>By connecting a Third Party Account you:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Allow us to access and store relevant information from that service as needed to operate and provide the features you request. This may include identifiers or metadata such as your user ID, display name, avatar, membership details, and similar information.</li>
					<li>Recognize that passwords and sensitive login credentials are never stored.</li>
					<li>Understand we use this information only to operate and maintain our services (e.g., to determine access permissions, manage server features, or configure dashboard settings).</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You acknowledge that we are not responsible for the policies, practices, or availability of the Third Party Account providers. It is your responsibility to review and understand their terms and privacy practices.</p>
				<h4 class=" text-decoration-underline mt-5">User Restrictions</h4>
				<p>When you use our services you agree to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Not violate the rights of any individual, group, or organization.</li>
					<li>Not engage in behavior that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
					<li>Not use the Services in any way that could damage, disable, or compromise the security of your (or others') accounts.</li>
					<li>Not give others access to your Third Party Account or impersonate another user.</li>
					<li>Not interfere with or disrupt our systems or services.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Violations of these may result in restrictions or permanent loss of access to the Services.</p>
				<h4 class=" text-decoration-underline mt-5">Data Collection and Use</h4>
				<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information beyond technical identifiers necessary for service functionality (such as user IDs, server IDs, and settings preferences).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>No passwords or sensitive authentication details are stored.</li>
					<li>No data is sold or used for advertising.</li>
					<li>Any collected data is used solely to support features like moderation, logging, dashboard customization, or responses.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 class=" text-decoration-underline mt-5">Data Access and Removal</h4>
				<p>If you no longer wish for the Services to retain any data related to you or your server, you may request data deletion at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:admin@rhykerw.com" class="link-light">admin@rhykerw.com</a> with sufficient information to identify your account or server. You may be asked to verify ownership or identity before data can be removed.</p>
				<p>In some cases, select information may be retained if required to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Comply with applicable laws or legal obligations</li>
					<li>Resolve disputes or enforce these Terms</li>
					<li>Support fraud prevention or abuse detection efforts</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some data may temporarily persist in server logs or backups due to security and operational protocols, but is excluded from future processing and purged routinely according to internal cleanup policies.</p>
				<h4 class=" text-decoration-underline mt-5">Termination and Access Control</h4>
				<p>Use of the Services is a privilege, not a right. We reserve the full and unconditional right to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Suspend, restrict, or terminate access to any user or server at any time.</li>
					<li>Block access from users, bots, or organizations determined to be malicious or in violation of these Terms.</li>
				</ul>
